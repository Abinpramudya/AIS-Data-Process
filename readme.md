# AIS Data Process

## Description
AIS, or Automatic Identification System, is a widely used technology in maritime navigation. It constantly transmits crucial ship data like position, identity, and speed, offering valuable insights for safety and efficiency. However, much of this rich data remains underutilized. In this project, I aim to unlock the potential of unused AIS data by applying machine learning to identifies ship states in the docking process by using data from AIS . By leveraging this data, we can identifies the current state of the ship in the docking process . This project contributes to the wider range that can be applies in data analysis.

## Installation

to install this project, all you need is:
-python 3.9 (minimum)
-sklearn library
-matplotlib library
-numpy library
-pandas library

## Usage

This project aim to predict the states for ship being in the process of docking, especially for the surabaya perak port, however the method should be work for other port aswell, given another dataset is use to train the model

## Contributing

The project mainly centered for the development of a bachelor thesis for a friend of mine, should any question arises, you can contact me instead.
